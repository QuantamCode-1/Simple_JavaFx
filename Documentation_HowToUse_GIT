Creating the Documentation for the GIT

First Install the Git hub whcih have both command line terminal and Graphical User Interface 

Create a folder Just like "JavaForGIT" for instance and inside it create another foler name JavaFX_ProjectOne
and now right click inside the JavaForGIT folder and choose git bash so Git terminal is opened.

Before doing anything first create your Git account and create a Repository so you push all your project insidet that Repository . 
Always give appropriate similar name to Repository similar to your Project File. Just instance Respository is Simple_JavaFX_Project
than always try to push only JAVA FX file only on it. Since it is not mandatory but good practice for future reference.

******************************************
If you already have Repository in GitHub and you want to rename that goto On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. 
Under your repository name, click Settings on top right. Under the Repository Name heading, type the new name of your repository. Click Rename.
