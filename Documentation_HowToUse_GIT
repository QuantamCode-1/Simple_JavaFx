Creating the Documentation for the GIT

First Install the Git hub whcih have both command line terminal and Graphical User Interface 

Create a folder Just like "JavaForGIT" for instance and inside it create another foler name JavaFX_ProjectOne
and now right click inside the JavaForGIT folder and choose git bash so Git terminal is opened.

Before doing anything first create your Git account and create a Repository so you push all your project insidet that Repository . 
Always give appropriate similar name to Repository similar to your Project File. Just instance Respository is Simple_JavaFX_Project
than always try to push only JAVA FX file only on it. Since it is not mandatory but good practice for future reference.

******************************************
If you already have Repository in GitHub and you want to rename that goto On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. 
Under your repository name, click Settings on top right. Under the Repository Name heading, type the new name of your repository. Click Rename.

Now Git Bash Terminal build Git on it by using following command

// create initailze git connector to github
$git init
(Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/kebib_000/Desktop/JavaForGIT/.git/)

//add the folder to github by adding the repository link address
$git remote add origin https://github.com/QuantamCode-1/Simple_JavaFx.git

// to check type following command
$git remote -v

// now to add all file use dot . after add command
$ git add .


$ git commit -m "First commit or whatever you want type in"

$ git push origin master


/***********************************************************************
Sometime error occur when you use the same link address whose init folder is already
created for that repository and trying to create new init and use same link 
so following error will be throws.
To push your folder files 


Raj Bhandari@ChetBhandari MINGW64 ~/Desktop/JavaForGIT (master)
$ git push origin master
To https://github.com/QuantamCode-1/Simple_JavaFx.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/QuantamCode-1/Simple_JavaFx.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

// To solove the above problem type the following command one by one and it will push the file to the repository

$ git fetch origin master:tmp
$ git rebase tmp
$ git push origin HEAD:master
$ git branch -D tmp


// or you can use force to input the file into the repository

git init
git add README.md
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/QuantamCode-1/Simple_JavaFx.git'
git push --force origin master

/*****************************************************
To delete the file or folder from the repository type following command

goto inside the JavaForGIT folder and you will find your uploaded folder
for instance in my case is JavaFX_DemoOne and inside that folder there is 
file called JavaFX_SartSimpleFrame

Now right click inside the JavaForGIT folder and open git bash terminla
type:
Raj Bhandari@ChetBhandari MINGW64 ~/Desktop/JavaForGIT (master)

$ git remote -v

//The follwoing message will be shown
origin  https://github.com/QuantamCode-1/Simple_JavaFx.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/QuantamCode-1/Simple_JavaFx.git (push)

// to see the list of all files and folder inside the repository type following
//command without using git command just ls -like

$ ls -l

//it will show following details for that respective repository
total 5
